## 🔬 How It Works

### The Science Behind Smart Learning

#### 🧠 Spaced Repetition Algorithm (SM-2 Modified)

Our implementation of the SuperMemo SM-2 algorithm with enhancements:

1. **Initial Learning**: New questions appear immediately
2. **Success Tracking**: Correct answers → longer intervals
3. **Difficulty Adjustment**: Wrong answers → reset to short intervals
4. **Ease Factor**: Adapts based on response time and accuracy

```python
# Example: Adaptive interval calculation
if correct_answer:
    if repetition == 0:
        interval = 1 day
    elif repetition == 1:
        interval = 6 days
    else:
        interval = previous_interval × ease_factor

ease_factor = max(1.3, ease_factor + (0.1 - (5-quality) × (0.08 + (5-quality) × 0.02)))
```

#### 🎯 Error Focus Algorithm

- **Difficulty Score**: `(1 - success_rate) × 100 + (3.0 - ease_factor) × 20`
- **Priority Ranking**: Questions sorted by difficulty for targeted practice
- **Smart Selection**: Balances new content with error-prone material

## 📚 Available Topics

The app comes with curated question sets across multiple domains:

- 🐍 **Python Programming** - Fundamentals to advanced concepts
- 💻 **Web Development** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript essentials
- ⚡ **C Programming** - Low-level programming concepts
- 📖 **General Programming** - Universal programming principles

### 📝 Adding Your Own Questions

Create JSON files in the `db/` directory:

```json
{
  "title": "Your Topic Name",
  "description": "Topic description",
  "duration": 300,
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is Python?",
      "answers": [
        "1. A programming language",
        "2. A snake",
        "3. A framework",
        "4. A library"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "hints": {
        "correct": "Excellent! Python is indeed a programming language.",
        "fail": "Not quite. Python is a high-level programming language."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### ⚙️ Customizing the Algorithm

You can modify the spaced repetition parameters in `SpacedRepetition.py`:

```python
# Adjust these values to customize learning behavior
INITIAL_EASE_FACTOR = 2.5    # Starting difficulty
MIN_EASE_FACTOR = 1.3        # Minimum difficulty
MAX_INTERVAL = 365           # Maximum review interval (days)
QUALITY_THRESHOLD = 3        # Minimum quality for success
```

### 📊 Analytics Customization

Modify analytics in `ErrorAnalyzer.py`:

```python
# Customize difficulty thresholds
MASTERY_THRESHOLD = 0.8      # 80% success rate for mastery
DIFFICULTY_THRESHOLD = 0.5   # 50% success rate for difficulty
SLOW_RESPONSE_TIME = 20      # Seconds for "slow" classification
```
